# What is this?

My math practise for data science based on [this skillbox course](https://skillbox.by/course/math-for-data-science/)

I already knew most of the things in this course, but this course helped me connect mathematics with ML, now I can say why I need a derivative, why in most cases approximation is better than interpolation, where we should use gradient descent and where not. Mathematics has become a practical tool, not just a theoretical one, and for me it is the key to understanding and remembering mathematics.
